#IoT Network Intrusion Detection Model

* This file contain a lot of work to make intrusion detection model for Iot networks.
* We used nerual network along with random forest algorithm to accomplish this task.
* We used UNSW-NB 15 data set to train and test the model.
* f-1 recall and other metrics were used.
* Matplotlib, keras, Tensorflow and HDF5 were used.
